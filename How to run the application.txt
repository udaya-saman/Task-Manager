Here's how to run the application:

   1. Prerequisites:
       * Make sure you have Node.js installed.
       * Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.

   2. Start the Backend Server:
       * Open a terminal in the project directory (F:\Uni Projects\SMALL\01 Simple Task Manager).
       * I will run the command: node server.js
       * The server will start on http://localhost:3000.

   3. Serve the Frontend:
       * Open a new terminal in the same project directory.
       * I will run the command: npx serve public
       * This will serve the index.html file. Note the URL it provides (it's often http://localhost:5000 or similar).

   4. Access the Application:
       * Open your web browser and go to the URL from the npx serve command.
